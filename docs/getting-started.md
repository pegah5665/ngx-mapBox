# Getting started

## Installing

To get started install the ngx-mapbox package from npm:

```text
npm i ngx-mapbox --S
```

yarn fans do:

```text
yarn add ngx-mapbox
```

You also need to install mapbox-gl because it does not ship with ngx-mapbox

```text
npm i mapbox-gl --S
```

or

```text
yarn add mapbox-gl
```

## Usage

First, you have to include the mapbox stylesheet somewhere in the head your index.html file.

```text
<head>
    ...
    <link href='https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v0.45.0/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet'/>
    ...
</head>
```
